# pazeifier

A dumb discord bot that I made for a friend.

# Installation

## Requirements

1. Up-to-date version of Cargo ([rustup](https://rustup.rs/) recommended)
2. Some version of openssl (you should have it by default)

## Building

1. Clone the repostiory
2. Run `cargo build`. Optionally add `--release` if you are building a release version

## Running

1. Set an environment variable for `DISCORD_TOKEN`. Doesn't matter how you do it. Make sure it belongs to a valid bot.
2. Either run the executable directly `./target/<debug or release>/pazeifier` or run `cargo run`
